Project Pipeline:
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: The GEOquery and affy R packages are used to load and preprocess microaaray gene expression data from the GEO database.
  Metadata file is downloaded directly from GEO.
- Count Matrix: Each preprocessed single-dataset is normalized and map theprobe IDs to gene symbols .
- Dimensionality reduction: The all data frames are dimensionality reduced using PCA algorithm to handle the huge genes compare to the small sample size. 
- Feature Selection: RFE used to selection the relevant genes that can accuratly classify the three main blood cancer types. 

Algorithms Used:
- SVM
- RF

Dependencies:
- GEOquery, affy,sesameData, tidyverse, sva for dowloading the data, normalize and batch correction using R.
- pandas reading file in Python.
- scikit-learn for preprocessing the data and Scaler, PCA, FS, models, and Evaluation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data and results.
