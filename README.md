# Machine Learning-Based Classification of Blood Cancer Types from Microarray Data
ML-project-Classification-of-Blood-Cancers

#### Blood cancers are the fifth most common type of cancer globally! Thus, the aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different types of blood cancers based on gene expression data, helping to improve diagnosis, reduce delays, and ensure better treatment outcomes.
