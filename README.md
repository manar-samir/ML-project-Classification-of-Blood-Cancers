# Machine Learning-Based Classification of Blood Cancer Types from Microarray Data

# Project Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different types of blood cancers, such as Leukemia, Lymphoma, and Multiple Myeloma based on gene expression data, helping to improve diagnosis, reduce delays, and ensure better treatment outcomes.
